# movie-api-project
This project is a web application that utilizes the OMDB-API to allow users to search for movies and retrieve information about them.
The HTML code represents the structure of the web page, including various containers for displaying search results and movie details. The CSS file (style.css) is used to define the visual styles of the elements on the page. The JavaScript code (index.js, loadMovies.js, initialLoadingPage.js, displayMovieDetails.js, loadMovieDetails.js, and displayMovieList.js) provides the functionality for fetching movie data from the OMDB-API, displaying search results, loading movie details, and handling user interactions. The project  focused on retrieving movie information based on user search queries and presenting it in a user-friendly manner.
